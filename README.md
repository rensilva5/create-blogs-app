- intall node or if you have it then:
- check version of your node by typing node -v.
- npx runs node.
- npx create-react-app (name of the project) then enter.
- cd 'name of the new project.
- then type 'code .' to go into visual code app
- node-modules is where all our project dependencies laid down.
- src folder contains about 99% of our work.
- delete reportWebVital, test.js, and setupTest.js files.
- index.js is basically a file that takes all the react components and and mountains to the DOM.
- <React.StrictMode> // checks and gives warnings.
- npm start or npm start commands to start running the browser.
- if we delete node-modules, we install them by typing npm install
- Component is esencially a function and it has to return something which is normally a jsx template.
